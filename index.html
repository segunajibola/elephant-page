          <h2>Taxonomy and Species</h2>
          <p>
            African elephants belong to the genus Loxodonta, comprising two
            living species: the African bush elephant and the African forest
            elephant. The bush elephant is currently considered endangered,
            while the forest elephant is critically endangered. The genetic
            divergence between these two species dates back 2.6 â€“ 5.6 million
            years.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            African elephants are characterized by their thick grey skin, large
            ears for heat regulation, and a versatile trunk used for various
            functions. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, which
            they use for various tasks, and molars that are replaced throughout
            their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The African bush elephant is the largest terrestrial animal and can
            weigh up to 8,000 kg. These elephants live in family units led by an
            older cow known as the matriarch, and male elephants form alliances
            with other males after puberty. They predominantly inhabit various
            regions across Africa.

            Feeding, Intelligence, and Reproduction: African elephants use their
            trunk and tusks for feeding, causing significant damage to foliage.
            They are highly intelligent, with a large and convoluted neocortex,
            showcasing behaviors such as memory and mimicry. Calves are born
            after a gestation period of nearly two years, and males enter a
            phase called musth around age 25.

          <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
          <p>
            These magnificent creatures face numerous threats, including ivory
            trafficking and poaching. Large-scale ivory poaching in Tanzania
            alone resulted in the loss of over 85,000 elephants between 2009 and
            2014. To combat these threats, various conservation efforts, such as
            the African Elephant Database and the Convention on International
            Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, have played
            significant roles in monitoring and protecting African elephant
            populations. Growing conflicts between elephants and human
            populations have also prompted research into safe methods of driving
            elephants away from humans.

            The African elephant is revered in many African
            cultures as a symbol of strength and power. It's also featured in
            the national emblems of several African countries, reflecting its
            immense significance within their culture and history.
